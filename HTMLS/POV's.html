            <h3>POV's</h3>
	        <h4>How men and women see gender equality differently</h4>
	        <p>#1. Potential versus performance</p>
        	<p>Men assume policy leads to positive impact. Women see that these policies are not leading to positive outcomes. For example, men saw that there was a programme to mentor women, which they viewed as an affirmative programme to help women’s progress. Women saw no results from the mentoring programme. For men, it was the potential and the effort that gave them a sense of well-being. For women, their conclusion of dissatisfaction was based on performance. Professor Cheryl Kaiser of the University of Washington refers to the “illusion of inclusion” in which people believe that discrimination and unfair practices can’t exist if there is a diversity office or set of programmes in place directed at these practices. There can be a distinct gap between the formal programmes and the informal work culture, thereby setting up the potential for the illusion.</p>

	        <p>#2. Confirmation bias</p>
        	<p>We all do this. It is the phenomenon of sorting facts and observations in a way that confirms what we already believe. So if men think progress is being made for women, they will place more weight on the facts they see and believe confirm the advancement, and pay less attention to the impact of the impediments. Women will similarly focus more on the facts that confirm lack of progress and less on the advancements.</p>
	
	        <p>#3. Cui bono?</p>
        	<p>Who most feels the impact of the unlevel playing field? When it comes to gender issues, men generally don’t feel the impact (this may not include men from historically powerless groups, who certainly can feel the effects). For women, gender issues have full impact, affecting their lives constantly. Our gender identities shape what hurts and helps us, knowingly or unknowingly. We are all right and we are all wrong in our different lenses.</p>

	        <p>#4. We want the same things</p>
        	<p>Both men and women are looking for the same thing at work, including compelling colleagues, mutual values and challenging work. Based on their experiences, men might be more likely to achieve those work goals; women, on the other hand, may have experiences that create a diminished sense of satisfaction. Given these feelings of dissatisfaction in the workplace, women may have a lower threshold when it comes to deciding whether to leave the world of work or not.</p>
